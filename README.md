# OctoUnroll
Unenrollment method for Octopus boards with SH1MMERS CSS/HTMl/JS
This method involes a set of TPM commands that removes Organization ownership
This method wont work in the future because google is geting rid of Disabling WP
So hopefully in them doing this they will just add an extra step to doing so
SO shim up and TPM down -Phill

Here is proof of them getting rid of the ability to Disable WP
