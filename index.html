    <h3>What is SH1MMER?</h3>
    <p>
      SH1MMER is an exploit capable of completely unenrolling
      enterprise-managed Chromebooks. It was found by
      the <a href="https://mercurywork.shop">Mercury Workshop team</a> and
      was released on January,
      <u onclick="alert(messages.friday)">Friday the 13th</u>, 2023.

      For more info, check out the <a href="https://coolelectronics.me/blog/breaking-cros-2">Writeup</a>
    </p>

    <h3>What you will need</h3>
    <li>A USB with at least 8 GBs of storage</li>
    <li>
      <u onclick="alert(messages.pc)">A personal computer or chromebook;</u> note that you
      need admin perms on Windows/MacOS
    </li>
    <hr />
    <h3>Writing to USB</h3>
    <p>
      First, you'll need to find your managed Chromebook's board name. This can
      be done by going to <kbd>chrome://version</kbd> on your Chromebook and
      copying the word after "stable-channel", or with
      <u onclick="alert(messages.board)">a variety of other methods</u>.
    </p>
    <p>
      If your board name is in the list below, your board has a publicly leaked RMA shim. If it's not, you'll have to
      source it
      on your own... somehow.
    </p>
    brask, brya, clapper, coral, dedede, enguarde, glimmer, grunt, hana,
    hatch, jacuzzi, kukui, nami, octopus, orco, pyro, reks, sentry, stout,
    strongbad, tidus, ultima, volteer, zork
    <p>
      First you need to download a sh1mmer bin. Download a shim at <a
        href="https://shim.the-repo.org/">shim.the-repo.org</a><br> , and build it with the <a
        href="/builder">sh1mmer web builder</a><br>
      Once you've obtained a MODIFIED SHIM (NOT A RAW SHIM), you can continue.
    </p>
      <pre>


        disable wp (cr50 or screw)

YOU WILL NEED TO UNPLUG YOUR BATTERY FOR THIS!!!

turn on chromebook and boot into sh1mmer

run unenroll in sh1mmer (will have an error, thats ok)

open sh1mmer bash shell and run /usr/share/vboot/bin/set_gbb_flags.sh 0x8090

**IMPORTANT: DO NOT RUN RESET GBB FLAGS AFTER THIS!!!**

now run the commands: 
flashrom --wp-disable 
sudo vpd -i RW_VPD -s check_enrollment=0
sudo vpd -i RW_VPD -s block_devmode=0
sudo crossystem block_devmode=0
(the flashrom --wp-disable command is for ease of access for later use, this will make it where if you accidentally re-enroll, it will keep WP disabled even if 
your wp screw or battery is in.)


turn off chromebook

enable wp

turn on cb and boot into dev mode (it will work trust me)

powerwash

Go back into the bash terminal

run these commands:
tpm_manager_client take_ownership
cryptohome --action=remove_firmware_management_parameters



powerwash

profit
It will say chromeos is missing or damaged so use a recovery usb.

        NOTE: if you're on Octopus you will have to have a recovery Usb recommend using v107 because its most stable.
      </pre>
      <h3></h3>
      <p>
        You will now be able to, among other things, unenroll your Chromebook.
        It will now behave entirely as if it is a personal computer and no
        longer contain spyware or blocker extensions. After you do this and get
        past the "determining device configuration" screen, you will be able to
        actually turn dev mode on. 

        One thing with this method is after you connect to your internet it will say it cant connect to google so 
        go into guest mode and leave guest mode to bypass this.
